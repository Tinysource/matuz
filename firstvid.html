<h1>Function Key</h1>
<p>A function key is one of the "F" keys along the top of a computer keyboard. On some keyboards, these range from F1 to F12, while others have function keys ranging from F1 to F19.
Function keys may be used as single key commands (e.g., F5) or may be combined with one or more modifier keys (e.g., Alt+F4). In either case, function keys typically serve as keyboard shortcuts to perform a specific function.

While function keys have been included on keyboards since the 1960s, they have not had a standard purpose. Over the years, various operating systems and applications have made use of function keys in different ways. While each software developer can decide how to use the "F keys" in his or her program, some actions have been universally recognized.

Below are some common uses for function keys in Windows:

F1 - Display help screen
F2 - Highlight file or folder for renaming
F3 - Open search tool
Alt+F4 - Close the current window
F5 - Refresh the contents of a window or webpage
F8 - Boot Windows into Safe Mode by holding F8 during startup
Higher number function keys are often used for common system actions, such as adjusting the speaker volume or the display brightness.

Based on your system settings, you may need to hold the "Fn" modifier key to perform system actions. In macOS, this is typically reversed, meaning the function keys perform system actions by default. For example, pressing F1 lowers the brightness, while F2 increases it. Pressing Fn+F1 sends an "F1" command rather than changing the brightness. For this reason, most Mac keyboards have icons on the function keys displaying the default function of each key.
</p>

<h1>FTP</h1>
<p>Stands for "File Transfer Protocol." FTP is a protocol designed for transferring files over the Internet. Files stored on an FTP server can be accessed using an FTP client, such as a web browser, FTP software program, or a command line interface.
An FTP server can be configured to enable different types of access. For example, an "anonymous FTP" configuration allows anyone to connect to the server. However, anonymous users may only be allowed to view certain directories and may not be able to upload files. If anonymous FTP access is disabled, users are required to log in in order to view and download files.

The standard FTP protocol is not encrypted, meaning it is vulnerable to packet sniffers and other types of snooping attacks. Therefore, the FTPS and SFTP protocols were developed to provide secure FTP connections. FTPS (FTP with SSL security) provides SSL encryption for all FTP communication. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure version of FTP that uses SSH to encrypt all data transfers.

To you connect to an FTP server, you first need to enter the server name and port number. The server name often starts with "ftp," such as "ftp.example.com." The standard port number for FTP is 21, while SFTP uses port 22 (SSH). If you connect via FTPS, you might be required to enter a custom port number, but the most common one is 990. In order to access an SFTP or FTPS server, you will also need to enter a username and password.

<h1>Framework</h1>
<p>A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices, and interact with system software. This streamlines the development process since programmers don't need to reinvent the wheel each time they develop a new application.
A framework is similar to an application programming interface (API), though technically a framework includes an API. As the name suggests, a framework serves as a foundation for programming, while an API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. A framework may also include code libraries, a compiler, and other programs used in the software development process.

Several different types of software frameworks exist. Popular examples include ActiveX and .NET for Windows development, Cocoa for Mac OS X, Cocoa Touch for iOS, and the Android Application Framework for Android. Software development kits (SDKs) are available for each of these frameworks and include programming tools designed specifically for the corresponding framework. For example, Apple's Xcode development software includes a Mac OS X SDK designed for writing and compiling applications for the Cocoa framework.

In many cases, a software framework is supported natively by an operating system. For example, a program written for the Android Application Framework will run on an Android device without requiring other additional files to be installed. However, some applications require a specific framework in order to run. For example, a Windows program may require Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0, which is not installed on all Windows machines (especially PCs running older versions of Windows). In this case, the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 installer package must be installed in order for the program to run.

NOTE: While frameworks generally refer to broad software development platforms, the term can also be used to describe a specific framework within a larger programming environment. For example, multiple Java frameworks, such as Spring, ZK, and the Java Collections Framework (JCF) can be used to create Java programs. Additionally, Apple has created several specific frameworks that can be accessed by OS X programs. These frameworks are saved with a .FRAMEWORK file extension and are installed in the /System/Library/Frameworks directory. Examples of OS X frameworks include AddressBook.framework, CoreAudio.framework, CoreText.framework, and QuickTime.framework.
</p>

<h1>Video Card</h1>
<p>Most of the processing done on a computer is done via the computer's central processing unit, or CPU. So in order to give the CPU a break and help it run more efficiently, a video card can be used to process the graphics portion of the processing load. Because most of today's programs are graphically oriented, the video card can help almost any program run more efficiently. However, the difference in performance is especially noticeable in image editing applications and 3D games.
Video cards, also called graphics accelerators, can speed up both 2D and 3D graphics rendering. Programs such as photo editors and Web browsers may benefit from 2D acceleration, while CAD design programs and video games will most likely benefit from the card's 3D acceleration. Some programs rely so heavily on the video card, that they will not run if a supported video card is not installed.

Most video cards support the OpenGL and DirectX libraries. These libraries include commands for manipulating graphics that programmers can include in their code. Some of these commands may include moving or rotating an object, morphing polygons, or casting light and creating shadows. By using standard OpenGL or DirectX functions, it makes it easier for developers to create graphically-oriented programs. Of course, it also makes it necessary for the computer to include a supported video card in order for the program to run.

Video cards are typically installed in either the PCI or AGP slots in the back of a computer. Most computers come with a video card installed in one of these slots, which means it can be upgraded at a later time.
</p>
<h1>Adapter</h1>
<p>An adapter is a device that allows a specific type of hardware to work with another device that would otherwise be incompatible. Examples of adapters include electrical adapters, video adapters, audio adapters, and network adapters.
An electrical adapter, for instance, may convert the incoming voltage from 120V to 12V, which is suitable for a radio or other small electronic device. Without regulating voltage through an adapter, the incoming electrical surge could literally fry the internal components of the device. Most consumer electronics have adapters attached to the plug at the end of the electrical cord. Whenever you see an plug surrounded by a large box, it is most likely an electrical adapter. You can typically find the input and output voltage printed directly on the adapter. A device that does not have an adapter on the end of its electrical cable typically has a built-in voltage adapter. For example, desktop computers typically have the adapter built into the internal power supply.

Video adapters and audio adapters adapt one type of interface to another type of connector. For example, a DVI to VGA adapter allows you to connect theDVI output of a laptop to the VGA input of a projector. Most professional audio devices use 1/4" audio jacks, while most computers have 1/8" "minijacks" for audio input and output. Therefore, 1/4" to 1/8" audio adapters are often used to import audio into computers. Likewise, an 1/8" to 1/4" adapter can used to output audio from a computer to a professional audio system. Since a large number of audio and video interfaces exist, there are hundreds of audio and video adapters available.

Network cards, or NICs, are also called network adapters. These include Ethernet cards, internal Wi-Fi chips, and external wireless transmitters. While these devices don't convert connections like audio or video adapters, they enable computers to connect to network. Since the network card makes it possible to connect to an otherwise incompatible network, the card serves as an adapter. Similarly, video cards are sometimes called video adapters because they convert a video signal to an image that can be displayed on a monitor.

<h1>Processor Core</h1>
<p>A processor core (or simply “core”) is an individual processor within a CPU. Many computers today have multi-core processors, meaning the CPU contains more than one core.
For many years, computer CPUs only had a single core. In the early 2000s, as processor clock speeds began plateauing, CPU manufacturers needed to find other ways to increase processing performance. Initially, they achieved this by putting multiple processors in high-end computers. While this was effective, it added significant cost to the computers and the multiprocessing performance was limited by the bus speed between the CPUs.

By combining processors on a single chip, CPU manufactures were able to increase performance more efficiently at a lower cost. The individual processing units became known as “cores” rather than processors. In the mid-2000s, dual-core and quad-core CPUs began replacing multi-processor configurations. While initially only high-end computers contained multiple cores, today nearly all PCs have multi-core processors.

NOTE: “Core” is also the name of Intel’s processor line, which replaced the Pentium lineup in 2006. Examples of Intel Core processors include the Core Duo, Core 2, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7.

<h1>Default Program</h1>
<p>A default program is an application that opens a file when you double-click it. For example, if you double-click a .TXT file in Windows and it automatically opens in Notepad, then Notepad is the default program for files with a ".txt" extension. If the file opens in Microsoft Word, then Microsoft Word is the default program.
Default programs are necessary since many file types can be opened by more than one program. For example, your computer may have over a dozen applications that can open .JPG files. Therefore, the operating system needs to know which program to open by default when you double-click a JPEG image file.

Both Windows and Macintosh computers store a list of default programs for each file extension. These relationships between programs and file extensions are also called "file associations." Both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems allow you to change file associations if you don't like the default program that is associated with a certain file type. For example, if you prefer to play MP3 files in iTunes rather than Windows Media Player, you can change the ".mp3" file association to iTunes. This will set iTunes as the default program for all .MP3 files.

Windows 7 has a built-in utility for configuring file associations called "Default Programs." This tool allows you to assign specific programs to one or more file extensions using a simple graphical interface. It also displays what file extensions are associated with each installed application. For more information on using the Windows 7 Default Programs tool, view the FileInfo.com Default Programs Help Article.

While Mac OS X does not include a Default Programs tool, you can simply right-click a file and choose "Open With…" to select a different program to open it. If you want to change the default program for a specific file, select the file and choose File → Get Info. Then select a different program in the "Open with:" section of the window. If you want to change the default program for all files with the same extension, press the "Change All…" button.
</p>



<h1>CD-R</h1>
<p>Stands for "Compact Disc Recordable." CD-R discs are blank CDs that can record data written by a CD burner. The word "recordable" is used because CD-Rs are often used to record audio, which can be played back by most CD players. However, many other kinds of data can also be written to a CD-R, so the discs are also referred to as "writable CDs."
The data burned onto a CD-R disc is permanent, meaning it can not be altered or erased like the data on a hard drive. Typically, once a CD has been burned, it will not be able to record any more data. Some CD burning programs can record data as "sessions," allowing a disc to be written to mulitple times until it is full. Each session creates a new partition on the disc, meaning a computer will read a disc with multiple sessions as multiple discs. CD-RWs, on the other hand, can be erased and completely re-recorded. Like CDs, the data on CD-RWs cannot be altered, meaning the disc has to be completely erased each time you want to add new data.

<h1>Format</h1>
<p>The term "format" has several meanings, related to 1) disk formatting, 2) page formatting, and 3) file formats.
1) Disk formatting

In order for storage media, such as a hard drive or flash drive to be recognized by your computer, it first needs to be initialized, or "formatted." Formatting a disk involves testing the disk and writing a new file system onto the disk. This enables the computer to read the disk's directory structure, which defines the way files and folders are organized on the disk.

You can use a disk utility program to format or reformat a disk. This will create a blank, empty disk for storing your files. Therefore, only format disks that don't contain important data or make sure you have backed up your data before reformatting a disk!

When you reformat a disk, it will appear to be empty. This is because the directory structure has been rewritten, making the entire disk space available for writing new data. However, the old files are still on the disk. They just don't show up since they are no longer included in the directory structure. So if you accidentally format a disk (which is pretty hard to do), you may be able to retrieve your files using a disk utility such as Norton Disk Doctor or DiskWarrior.

2) Page formatting

The term "format" can also be used to describe the page layout or style of text in a word processing document. When you format the layout of a page, you can modify the page size, page margins, and line spacing. When you format the text, you can choose the font and font size, as well as text styles, such as bold, underlined, and italics.

3) File formats

A file format refers to the way data is saved within a file. For example, some files are saved in a plain text format, while others are saved as binary files. Software developers often create proprietary file formats for their programs, which prevents the files from being used by other applications.

<h1>PC</h1>
<p>Stands for "Personal computer." PCs are what most of us use on a daily basis for work or personal use. A typical PC includes a system unit, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Most PCs today also have a network or Internet connection, as well as ports for connecting peripheral devices, such as digital cameras, printers, scanners, speakers, external hard drives, and other components.
Personal computers allow us to write papers, create spreadsheets, track our finances, play games, and do many other things. If a PC is connected to the Internet, it can be used to browse the Web, check e-mail, communicate with friends via instant messaging programs, and download files. PCs have become such an integral part of our lives that it can be difficult to imagine life without them!

While PC stands for "personal computer," the term can be a bit ambiguous. This is because Macintosh computers are often contrasted with PCs, even though Macs are also technically PCs. However, Apple itself has used the term "PC" to refer to Windows-based machines, as opposed to its own computers, which are called "Macs." While the Mac/PC dilemma remains, PCs can always contrasted with other types of computers, such as mainframes and server computers, such as Web servers and network file servers. In other words, if you use a computer at home or at work, you can safely call it a PC.

<h1>Attachment</h1>
<p>An attachment, or email attachment, is a file sent with an email message. It may be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file.
Most email clients and webmail systems allow you to send and receive attachments. To send an attachment along with your email, you can use the "Attach" command, then browse to the file you want to attach. In some email interfaces, you can simply drag a file into the message window to attach it. When you receive an attachment, most email programs allow you to   view the attachment in place or save it to your local storage device.

While modern email programs make it easy to send and receive attachments, the original email system (SMTP) was actually not designed to handle binary files. Therefore, attachments must be encoded as text in order to be transferred with an email message. The most common encoding type is MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions). While MIME encoding makes it possible to send messages with emails, it typically increases the file size of the attachment about 30%. That's why when you attach a file to an email message, the file size of the attachment appears larger than the original file.

You can attach multiple files to a single email message. However, the maximum size of the combined attachments is limited by the sending and receiving mail servers. In other words, the size of the attachment(s) after being encoded cannot be larger than the limit of either the outgoing or incoming mail server. In the early days of email, attachments were limited to one megabyte (1 MB). Today, many mail servers allow attachments larger than 20 MB. However, to protect against viruses and malware, many mail servers will not accept executable file types, such as .EXE or .PIF files. If you need to send an executable file to someone, you can compress the file as a .ZIP archive before attaching it to the email message.

NOTE: Even a large amount of text takes up a small amount of space compared to most binary files. Therefore, attaching a document to an email may increase the size substantially. For example, a typical email may only require one kilobyte (1 KB) of disk space. Attaching a single 1 MB file will make the message 1,000 times larger. Therefore, it is best to share large files using another method like FTP or DropBox. Additionally, if you have almost reached your email quota on your mail server, you can free up a lot of space by deleting old attachments.
</p>

<h1>IDE</h1>
<p>IDE stands for both "Integrated Device Electronics" and "Integrated Development Environment." The first is a hardware term, while the second is related to software programming.
1. Integrated Device Electronics
IDE was the most widely-used type of hard drive from the mid 1990s to the late 2000s. The "integrated" aspect of the name describes how the controller is integrated into the drive itself. IDE and ATA are often used synonymously since they both refer to the same type of hard drive. However, ATA describes the interface while IDE describes the actual hard drive.

The first IDE standard (ATA-1) was released in 1994 and supported data transfer rates of 8.3 Mbps in DMA mode. Enhanced IDE (ATA-2) was standardized in 1996 and supported data transfer rates up to 16.7 Mbps – twice the rate of the original standard. The next several IDE standards were labeled using ATA versions (up to ATA-7), maxing out at 133 Mbps. The IDE interface was eventually superseded by SATA, an even faster interface.

2. Integrated Development Environment
A software IDE is an application that developers use to create computer programs. In this case, "integrated" refers to the way multiple development tools are combined into a single program. For example, a typical IDE includes a source code editor, debugger, and compiler. Most IDEs also provide a project interface that allows programmers to keep track of all files related to a project. Many support version control as well.

Some IDEs provide a runtime environment (RTE) for testing software programs. When a program is run within the RTE, the developer can track each event that takes place within the application being tested. This can be useful for finding and fixing bugs and locating the source of memory leaks. Because IDEs provide a centralized user interface for writing code and testing programs, a programmer can make a quick change, recompile the program, and run the program again. Programming is still hard work, but IDE software helps streamline the development process.

</p>

<h1>Laptop</h1>
<p>Laptop computers, also known as notebooks, are portable computers that you can take with you and use in different environments. They include a screen, keyboard, and a trackpad or trackball, which serves as the mouse. Because laptops are meant to be used on the go, they have a battery which allows them to operate without being plugged into a power outlet. Laptops also include a power adapter that allows them to use power from an outlet and recharges the battery.
While portable computers used to be significantly slower and less capable than desktop computers, advances in manufacturing technology have enabled laptops to perform nearly as well as their desktop counterparts. In fact, high-end laptops often perform better than low or even mid-range desktop systems. Most laptops also include several I/O ports, such as USB ports, that allow standard keyboards and mice to be used with the laptop. Modern laptops often include a wireless networking adapter as well, allowing users to access the Internet without requiring any wires.

While laptops can be powerful and convenient, the convenience often comes at a price. Most laptops cost several hundred dollars more than a similarly equipped desktop model with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Furthermore, working long hours on a laptop with a small screen and keyboard may be more fatiguing than working on a desktop system. Therefore, if portability is not a requirement for your computer, you may find better value in a desktop model.
